# WordPress Installer License

The License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the WordPress installer you have ordered.

* You are licensed to use the installer to create one single End Product (WordPress server, single public IP address) for yourself or for one client. This means you are only allowed to use the install on a single server or IP address (a “single WordPess application”).

* You can create one server for a you or client with WordPress installer, and you can transfer that End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client install.

* You can not make any number of copies of the WordPress installer.

* You can not modify or manipulate the WordPress installer. You can't combine the WordPress installer with other works and make a derivative work from it.

* You can’t sell the WordPress installer.

* You can’t re-distribute the WordPress installer. You can’t re-distribute or make available the WordPress installer as-is or with superficial modifications. These things are not allowed.

* You must not permit an end user of the WordPress installer to extract the WordPress installer and use it separately from the service.

* You can only use the WordPress installer for lawful purposes.

* This license applies in conjunction with the Openbridge Terms for your use of the WordPress installer. If there is an inconsistency between this license and the WordPress installer terms, this license will apply to the extent necessary to resolve the inconsistency.

* This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from it.

* The author of the WordPress installer retains ownership of the WordPress installer but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between the author of the WordPress installer and you.
