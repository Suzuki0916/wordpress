# Docker Wordpress with Nginx, PHP-FPM, MariaDB and Redis

Our WordPress Stack provides an automated, super fast solution for those who prefer self-hosted WordPress installs. This Wordpress stack is based on lightweight, secure, up-to-date, and highly optimized Docker images. This includes a best of breed collection of Docker images from [NGINX](https://github.com/openbridge/nginx), [PHP-FPM](https://github.com/openbridge/ob_php-fpm), MariaDB and Redis. Together they create a performance driven, flexible environment that delivers reliability, security, and scale.

**Note:** This document is the support doc used by our AWS AMI: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07FCV1BPF

# Features
Our NGINX and PHP optimizations ensure optimal Wordpress performance, reducing or eliminating the need of the overhead related to costly Wordpress plugins. As a result you can easily serve millions of requests a day with minimal CPU, RAM and disk resources. [Nginx](https://github.com/openbridge/nginx), [PHP-FPM](https://github.com/openbridge/ob_php-fpm), MariaDB and Redis have been combined to deliver the following features:

* Reverse Proxy
* SEO optimizations
* Customizable configurations
* SSL with support for Lets Encrypt SSL certificates
* Mime-type based caching
* Redis LRU cache
* Fastcgi cache
* Proxy cache
* tmpfs file cache
* Brotli and Gzip compression
* Redirects for moved content
* [Security & Bot Protection](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker)
* Monitoring processes, ports, permissions... with Monit
* Standardized UID/GID and Permissions (www-data)
* Support GeoIP
* Rate limited connections to slow down attackers
* CDN support
* Cache purge
* Opcache
* Pair with [high performance PHP-FPM container](https://github.com/openbridge/ob_php-fpm)
* ACME: The simplest shell script for Let's Encrypt free certificate client (https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh)

There are many, many other benefits to this system. Give it a try!

# Step 1: Launch Amazon EC2 AMI with USERDATA
The first step is to activate is visiting the AWS Marketplace (https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07FCV1BPF) and subscribing to the service.

**Note:** If you are looking to deploy to another host like Google Cloud, Digital Ocean or even AWS Lightsail, contact us.

## Set your domain via USERDATA
We will auto provision you a `letsencrypt` SSL certificate if you have DNS assigned to your instance. The process is recommended and greatly simplifies your setup.

**Note:** USERDATA ONLY applies when launching your AMI, not during a `start`/`stop` of an instance.

### How To Set USERDATA?
When launching your AMI put the following in as `USERDATA` replacing `{{yourhost.com}}` with your instance DNS. When launching your AMI simply set:

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "SERVER_HOSTNAME=yourhost.com" > /home/ec2-user/host.sh
```

It will look like this:

![Image of Default Wordpress Site](./ami-userdata2.png)

Close up:

![Image of Default Wordpress Site](./ami-userdata.png)

Setting `USERDATA` will set the host name in your instance. If you do not set the `USERDATA`. we will use the instance host name set by AWS.

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "SERVER_HOSTNAME=yourhost.com" > /home/ec2-user/host.sh
```

We require you use the a domain (`yourhost.com` or `www.yourhost.com`). This will ensure that everything is correctly auto configured on your behalf. For example, if you set `www.yourhost.com` NGINX will set it a server as `www.yourhost.com`. The domain `yourhost.com` is a placeholder, an example, Do not blindly use `yourhost.com`!! It seems obvious, but not to everyone.

Remember, if you decide not to set DNS via `USERDATA` go to **Step 3**. You will need to manually configure SSL. We will install self-signed SSL certs as a temporary solution until you can configure everything according to the process outlined in Step 3.

### IMPORTANT
Make sure your IP (x.x.x.x) points to a DNS A Record uses the domain you set via USERDATA ( `yourhost.com` or `www.yourhost.com` ).

**This must be done in advance of starting your AMI else the setup process and `letsencrypt` will not be able to resolve the name to your instance.** This will put your instance in an unstable state. Ideally, use static elastic IP address. This makes it super simple to setup your domain and IP in advance. Otherwise AWS will assign a dynamic IP address which you will need to copy and enter into your DNS records.

In this example we pasted the IP address as an A record for our target domain like this:

![Image of setting up DNS A record](./route53.png)


# Step 2: Welcome! Your new Wordpress install is activated
**Congratulations!** If you have launched the AMI you will have your default Wordpress site up and running in a few minutes.

To verify your server is active visit the test page here: `https://yourhost.com/index.html`. If you did not set a domain, use the default Amazon EC2 address would look like this: `https://ec2-22-123-98-217.compute-1.amazonaws.com/index.html`

Once your Wordpress install is complete, or if you set your hostname via `USERDATA`, then you can connect to it like `https://yourhost.com`.

**Note:** You will want to delete the test `index.html`.

The default Wordpress install visually looks like:

![Image of Default Wordpress Site](./generic-install-small.png)

If you want to log into the `wp-admin` console, you need to get your password. The default the `wp-admin` password will be your EC2 Instance ID:

![Image of Default Wordpress Site](./instance-id.png)

You can also get it from AWS console by looking at the `Get System Logs` and scrolling for `WORDPRESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. You can also SSH into your instance and get the creds.


# Step 3: Manual Setup of SSL
Did you setup DNS via `USERDATA`? No, then you need to set your domain name and get your SSL setup. If you do not set your host via AMI `USERDATA` we will install self-signed SSL certificates. This will be enough to get you up and running. The following section describes how you can manually set your server host and install SSL certificates.

## Manually Configuring your SSL certificates
Your base Wordpress install comes with self-signed certs if you did not set the DNS via `USERDATA`. It will look like this:

![Image of Default Wordpress Site](./generic-ssl.png)

You will certainly want to change these.

### Understanding how SSL certs are organized

To keep things organized we default to using  [`letsencrypt`](https://letsencrypt.org/) for SSL certificates/keys, paths and naming conventions. Even if you are using your own certs, follow the naming conventions detailed below.

In keeping with the `letsencrypt` conventions make sure your certs are using the same naming scheme:
```bash
/etc/letsencrypt/live/${NGINX_SERVER_NAME}/;
├── server
│   ├── cert.pem
│   ├── chain.pem
│   ├── fullchain.pem
│   └── privkey.pem
```
The default locations for the SSL certs are in `/conf.d/ssl.conf`:
```nginx
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{NGINX_SERVER_NAME}}/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{NGINX_SERVER_NAME}}/privkey.pem;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{NGINX_SERVER_NAME}}/chain.pem;
```
Even if you are not using letsencrypt simple repurpose the path above.

## Using `certbot` for `letsencrypt` SSL certs
On your **host**, not in the Docker image,  we pre-installed the `certbot` Docker image.

First, make sure your `NGINX` is not running. You need to do this because `cerbot` needs to have post 80 and 443 open. If `NGINX` is running, there will be a port conflict. This will gracefully close down everything:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /home/ec2-user/wordpress.yml down --remove-orphans
```

Next, provision your SSL certificates:

```bash
docker pull certbot/certbot

docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name certbot -v "/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" -v "/var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt" certbot/certbot certonly -n --debug --agree-tos --email user@gmail.com --standalone -d ${SERVER_HOSTNAME}
```

Then start up all your services again:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /home/ec2-user/wordpress.yml up -d --remove-orphans
```


## Automate `letsencrypt` SSL renewals
You will need to setup a renewal process. The docs say check twice a day for changes. Lets add the renewal process to cron:
```bash
cat << EOF > /tmp/crontab.conf
55 4,16 * * * /opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/local/bin/pip install --upgrade certbot
59 4,16 * * * certbot-auto certonly -n --debug --agree-tos --pre-hook="docker stop nginx" --post-hook="docker start nginx" --standalone -d *.yourhost.com > /dev/null
EOF
```
Lastly, add everything to cron via `cat /tmp/crontab.conf | crontab - && crontab -l`

We have also installed ACME.sh (https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh). If you prefer, you can use this as your client for Lets Encrypt!

## Do you already have SSL certs?
For reference, we mount SSL certs to a directory on the host: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>`.

If you need to set SSL certs manually because you have them already via some other third party, then read on.

### Edit `wordpress.yml`
First, make sure you place your certs on the host in this path: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>`.

Next, we want to add the path to your certs into the Docker compose file. In the compose yml file see the SSL certs under the `nginx` block.

Here is the where you can find the file on the host: `/home/ec2-user/wordpress.yml`

You will already see `- wordpress_data:/usr/share/nginx/html` present. You want to add the following into the compose file. Remember to put use the actual domain you want to use in place of `<yourdomain>`:

```bash
volumes:
  - wordpress_data:/usr/share/nginx/html
  - /etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/fullchain.pem:/etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/fullchain.pem
  - /etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/privkey.pem:/etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/privkey.pem
  - /etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/chain.pem:/etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/chain.pem
```

If you do not have a `chain.pem`, simply copy the `fullchain.pem` over.

```bash
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/fullchain.pem  /etc/letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/chain.pem
```
After making the change to the compose file, save it. Then run this command to start everything:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /home/ec2-user/wordpress.yml up -d --remove-orphans
```


# Docker Configuration


## Starting and Stopping Your Docker Services

If you want to `start` all your services, the command is:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /home/ec2-user/wordpress.yml up -d --remove-orphans
```
If you want to `stop` all your services, the command is:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /home/ec2-user/wordpress.yml down --remove-orphans
```

## Advanced Configuration
When you SSH into your server go to your `HOME` directory. In there you will see a `wordpress.env` file that was created for you. This is used by your Docker containers to initialize various container settings.

Here is what is resident in the file:

```
# Nginx Server
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=ec2-54-162-77-237.compute-1.amazonaws.com or yourhost.com
NGINX_APP_PLUGIN=wordpress
NGINX_CONFIG=php
NGINX_DEV_INSTALL=
NGINX_DOCROOT=/usr/share/nginx/html

# Wordpress Settings
WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=YechHICDZS3rhEAR41zeqnusIUxjJTew
WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress
WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wordpress
WORDPRESS_ADMIN=admin
WORDPRESS_VERSION=latest
WORDPRESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=zPGW747e7XMazvt2
WORDPRESS_ADMIN_EMAIL=bob@gmail.com

# PHP Configuration
APP_DOCROOT=/usr/share/nginx/html
PHP_START_SERVERS=16
PHP_MIN_SPARE_SERVERS=8
PHP_MAX_SPARE_SERVERS=16
PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=256
PHP_OPCACHE_ENABLE=1
PHP_OPCACHE_MEMORY_CONSUMPTION=96
PHP_MAX_CHILDREN=16

# Upstream Servers
WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mariadb:3306
WORDPRESS_REDIS_HOST=redis:6379
NGINX_PROXY_UPSTREAM=localhost:8080
REDIS_UPSTREAM=redis:6379
PHP_FPM_UPSTREAM=php-fpm:9000
PHP_FPM_PORT=9000
```

If you did not set DNS via `USERDATA` then there is only one place you will need to edit, which is `NGINX_SERVER_NAME`. You will likely see the AWS default. We default to the name assigned by AWS which would look like `ec2-22-123-98-217.compute-1.amazonaws.com`. You need to change this to reflect your actual domain name (not the AWS one). You do this by setting `NGINX_SERVER_NAME`.

* `NGINX_SERVER_NAME` sets the default server name in `nginx.conf` and a few other locations. If you do not set this it will default to `localhost`. Typically this will be your domain name like `www.openbridge.com`. Note: Incorrectly setting a server name can create issues as many parts of the service rely on this matching your domain.

Also, you will also want to take note of the `WORDPRESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. This is the password you would use to login to Wordpress via the `wp-admin` console.
The default username is set via `WORDPRESS_ADMIN` and is `admin`.

As always, keep your ENV file safe and secure.

### Only change if you know what you are doing
Don't change any of the defaults for these unless you are a pro and understand what you are doing:

* `NGINX_DOCROOT` sets the default www directory. The containers default to `/usr/share/nginx/html` so it is best left unchanged.
* `NGINX_CONFIG` sets the default configuration director for your image. See the `/conf` directory to review a `html` and `php` configuration. Since Wordpress is a PHP based application leave this as `php`.
* `PHP_FPM_UPSTREAM` sets the upstream server(s) to connect with to `php-fpm:9000`. The `PHP_FPM_PORT` should also remain unchanged as `PHP_FPM_PORT=9000`.
* `NGINX_PROXY_UPSTREAM` sets the upstream server(s) for the reverse proxy to connect with. Since the proxy is local to the container we use `localhost.com:8080`.
* `REDIS_UPSTREAM` sets the Redis LRU cache to `redis:6379`.
* The `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST` and `WORDPRESS_REDIS_HOST` mirror the same settings above. These will be `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mariadb:3306` and `WORDPRESS_REDIS_HOST=redis:6379`.

You can set a collection of dummy files and certs for local testing:
* `NGINX_DEV_INSTALL` Set to `true` if you want self-signed SSL certs installed and "hello world" HTML and PHP pages installed. This is useful for testing.
* NOTE: Self-signed SSL certificates are always installed if the system does not detect here in the default cert location at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/{HOST}/`

If the rest of the `wordpress.env` variables don't look familiar, don't touch them ; )

## Using WP-CLI to manage your Wordpress install
WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. You can update plugins, configure multisite installs and much more, without using a web browser.

WP-CLI is installed at `/usr/bin/wp`. To run WP-CLI commands make sure you are located in the Wordpress root directory. In this case it is `/usr/share/nginx/html`

Here is just one example of using WP-CLI to activate plugins:
```bash
wp --allow-root plugin install amp antispam-bee nginx-helper wp-mail-smtp wordpress-seo redis-cache --activate
```
For a full list of commands, check out the [WP-CLI docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/).
